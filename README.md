# Bibot (From _The Scarlet Pimpernel_)
Welcome to this unique discord bot! It is inspired from the novel, *The Scarlet Pimpernel*. In the novel, there is a character named Sergeant Bibot. He utters, "Morbleu!", [which expresses surprise and/or annoyance in French](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/morbleu).

This is a simple bot that returns "Morbleu!" when someone in the chat says, "Bibot".
